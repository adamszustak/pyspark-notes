# PySpark Flight Data Transformations 
Welcome to the PySpark Flight Data Transformations repo! Here, you'll find Jupyter Notebook filled with examples on how to process and analyze **flight data using PySpark**, targeting both data engineering and analytical insights. The examples range from data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing to more sophisticated analyses like aggregations, joins, and window functions, all using a CSV file of flight information as the foundation. 🐍🐍🐍
